A fully functional Ai text-to-image Generator making use of huggingface.co's Openjourney stable diffusion model trained on Midjourney.

Written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This project served as more of a deeper dive into my skills with Javascript. Playing around with different AI models and API's has renewed my interset in the field.
